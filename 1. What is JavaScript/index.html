      <u>What is JavaScript?</u></h1>
    </h1>
    <h2 style="width: 80%; margin: 100px auto; font-weight: 500;font-size: 30px;">
      JavaScript is a synchronous and single-threaded client side scrpting language. But now-a-days we can use JavaScript for server-side(backend) development as well with the help of NodeJS(JavaScript runtime built on top of chrome's V8 engine which helps to run JavaScript outside the browser).<br><br>
      JavaScript was <b>developed by Brendan Eich</b> in the year 1995.<br>
      JavaScript's initial name was <b>Mocha.</b><br><br>
      
      <b>synchronous</b> => Tasks are done one after the other(in order).<br>
      <b>single-threaded</b> => All tasks are performed on a single thread which is the main thread(<b>call stack</b>).
