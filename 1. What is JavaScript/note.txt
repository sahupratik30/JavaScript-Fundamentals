What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a synchronous and single-threaded client side scrpting language. But now-a-days we can use JavaScript for server-side(backend) development as well with the help of NodeJS(JavaScript runtime built on top of chrome's V8 engine which helps to run JavaScript outside the browser).
JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in the year 1995.
JavaScript's initial name was Mocha.

synchronous => Tasks are done one after the other(in order).
single-threaded => All tasks are performed on a single thread which is the main thread(call stack).
