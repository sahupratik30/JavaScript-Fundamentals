  </h1>
  <p>Whenever we run any JavaScript code a <b>global execution context</b> is created.<br>
    Whenever a function is called or invoked, an <b>execution context</b> is created for that function.<br><br>
    An execution context consists of two phases:<br>
    1) Memory allocation phase<br>
    2) Code execution phase<br><br>
    <b>Memory allocation phase:</b><br>
    - In this phase, memory is allocated to all the variables and functions.<br>
    - Initially all the variables are initialized with a value of undefined.<br>
    - All the functions are initialized with the entire function body.<br><br>
    <b>Code execution phase:</b><br>
    - In this phase, the code is executed line by line.<br>
    - If any function call is encountered while code execution then an execution context for the function is created.
